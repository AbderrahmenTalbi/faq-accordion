1. Please introduce your team and each team member.

We are the proud Grand Prize winners of the 2025 Huawei ICT Competition Global Finals, representing Algeria. Our team is composed of three passionate and dedicated computer science students from the Higher School of Computer Science (ESI) in Sidi Bel Abbès, Algeria:

    Talbi Abderrahmen (myself): A driven learner and aspiring engineer with a passion f or innovation and technology.

    Della Abderrahmen: A talented teammate with exceptional technical problem-solving skills and a collaborative spirit.

    Mehloul Mohamed: A detail-oriented coder who brings precision and clarity to everything we build.

We were guided by our brilliant instructor, Anis Messaoudi, who graduated from the University of Béjaïa and played a key role in mentoring and supporting us throughout the journey.

2. What have you gained from the competition?

The Huawei ICT Competition was a life-changing experience. It pushed the boundaries of what I thought I was capable of. Not only did it allow me to put my knowledge and skills into real-world challenges, but it also helped me grow both professionally and personally. I became more confident, more adaptable, and more determined to pursue excellence in everything I do.

Additionally, the competition expanded my global network. I met inspiring people from all over the world — students, professionals, and experts — each sharing the same passion for technology. This international exposure has been one of the most valuable takeaways for me.

3. What problems did you encounter during the competition? How did you overcome them?

Preparing for the competition was not without its challenges. As full-time students, balancing coursework, exams, and projects with intense competition preparation was a real test of time management and perseverance.

Moreover, during the finals, we experienced physical fatigue due to long travel from Algeria to China and the time zone adjustment, which made it difficult to rest properly the night before. However, through strong teamwork, mutual support, and the guidance of our instructor, we overcame these hurdles. Our shared determination and belief in one another helped us turn every obstacle into an opportunity to shine.

4. What impressed you most during the Huawei ICT Competition?

The organization and professionalism of the competition were truly impressive. From the opening ceremony to the final award presentation, everything was executed with excellence. The cultural exchange, the hospitality, the advanced infrastructure — it was all incredibly well-coordinated.

What stood out most was the atmosphere of collaboration and passion. Being surrounded by so many brilliant minds, all working towards innovation and progress, was both humbling and motivating.

5. How do you think this award will affect your future development?

This award marks the beginning of a new chapter in my journey. It’s not just a recognition of what we’ve achieved, but a strong motivation to keep moving forward. It gives me the confidence to aim higher, learn deeper, and contribute more meaningfully to the tech world.

It also opens doors to new opportunities — internships, research, collaborations — and affirms that with hard work, global recognition is within reach. I now feel more empowered to shape my future and make an impact in the ICT field.

6. What messages or advice do you have for next year's contestants?

To the future competitors: don’t be afraid to try. Not trying is worse than failing. Even if you don’t succeed on your first attempt, keep learning, keep growing, and keep pushing. Persistence beats perfection.

This competition is more than just a contest — it’s a journey of growth. Embrace the process, support your teammates, trust your instructor, and believe in yourself. With passion and perseverance, you will reach your destination.
